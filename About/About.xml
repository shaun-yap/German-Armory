	<description>Combines the Kaiser Armory(KA)Reich Armory(RA) by ALIEN with heavy modifications. ALIEN is aware of this mod but it isn't an official branch.

There is no dependancy for his two mods, but keep in mind that if you do run either one of them with this mod, it will cause issues.

Changes as follows:

Category
- Weapons are in their own sub category in Weapons, rather than it's own. I don't know if I want them in Ranged and Melee, rather than their own one right now.

Research
- Research is split into tech (Bolt action, etc), rather than chronologically.
- All ammo for artillery now unlocks with the gun, instead of flooding your crafting table with ammo you can't use.

Work bench
- Halved power requirement for the table
- Table will now not allow overlap of the crafting spot
- Table will operate at 30% efficiency when it is unpowered.

FK 96
- Shells can arc over obstacles but cannot fire without LOS. I'm looking at allowing it to fire close to itself without LOS but I think this might require extra coding..
- AP shell now deals 160 base damage, flies faster, has a reduced chemfuel cost, and increased steel cost.

Nebelwerfer
- Adds a poison gas round, deal (very overpowered for now) damage to your enemies.
- Poison gas and smoke shells now require less chemfuel to make.
- The poison gas recipe now requires something poisonous, luciferium. 

Trading
- All rounds should now appear in trader inventories. So buy ammo not make em?

Sniper Variants
- Sniper variants of any rifle now deals double damage (36) and has an increased range
- Upgrading to the Sniper/Bayonet classes now just require resources and work(based on what you're adding, it's all base values with slight tweaks) rather than requiring a separate crafting queue.
- Gave the Gew 98 a sniper variant too.

Kar 98K B.Patronen
- Adds a Kar 98K B.Patronen, insipired by the sniper from Company of Heroes 2. It lights people up so uh, watch out for fire...

Feldspaten
- Feldspaten is combined from the two mods. Not really a point to have multiple. Having colonists with these equipped gives you a substantial mining speed boost (150%) and a moderate yield boost (50%).

Ammo boxes, bayonets, scopes
- Removed. Upgrading now consumes the resources and the work required to make the upgrade item (ie scopes) rather than requiring a second production line
